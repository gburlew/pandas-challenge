      "In this analysis, we observe the scores of students in different types of schools regarding their math and reading scores, along with the percent of students that are passing both math and reading overall. Out of 15 schools analyzed, there were 39,170 students total, along with a total budget of $24,649,428. On average, when no other comparison was made, students' math scores came to 78.98%, and their reading scores 81%. However, the percentage of students passing both math and reading was much lower, at 65%. For all schools, the budget per student ranged from $578 to $655. However, schools with the highest budgets per student didn't necessarily mean that their students would perform the best in comparison to the other schools. For example, Hernandez High School had a budget of $652 per student, but the percent of students who were passing both math and reading was as low as 53%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with that, Canbrera High school had a budget of $582 per student, but its students performed better than any other school in this analysis, with 91% of students passing both math and reading. When separating the analysis by grade, then comparing by schools, each grade's scores were usually within 3% of each other. There was no direct correlation between the grade a student was in, and the overall that score they would receive. Circling back to observing scores by a school spending, the results were the opposite of what one might expect. The lower the budget per student that each school had, the higher that the school's students would perform, with the schools that had less than $585 to spend on each student having 90% of their students passing both math and reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When observing the scores by the size of each school, the schools with 1000-2000 students performed the highest overall. However, the schools with less than 1000 students had nearly identical scores to the medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) regarding math and reading. There was a less than a 1% difference in the percent of students who were passing both math and reading. Once a school's population went above 2000 students, the percentage of students passing both classes dropped significantly, with an average of 58%. One might come to the conclusion that once a school's population exceeds 2000 students, scores will drop drastically in comparison to the rest of the schools with fewer students.\n",
